                <ul>
                    <li>Think of a purchase that would best help drive your project forward and make that your cash out goal - it will keep motivated and focused on building a stash that youâ€™ll spend wisely.</li>
                    <li>If youâ€™ve won a prize, make sure you thank your fellow community members! They wanted you to win, and will love hearing how you plan to use your winnings to support your business.</li>
                    <li>Winning prizes is a great perk, but it wonâ€™t happen every week. The HackerStash community survives and thrives by putting people first, prizes second.</li>
