    <p>Thanks for signing up to HackerStash. Please use the following temporary code to access your account:</p>
    {{ token_box(token) }}
    <p>Psst…we use codes instead of passwords as it’s much more secure. You’ll receive these one-time, randomly generated codes each future time you log in to HackerStash.</p>
    <p>(If you didn't try to sign up, you can safely ignore this email.)</p>
